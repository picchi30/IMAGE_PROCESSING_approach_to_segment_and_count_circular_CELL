RBC Counting and Analysis

This repository contains code for RBC Red Blood Cell counting and analysis using image processing techniques. The project aims to accurately count RBCs, including handling overlapping cells, using Python and OpenCV.

Purpose of CBC Complete Blood Count

CBC is a routine blood test that evaluates various components of blood, including RBC Red Blood Cells WBC White Blood Cells Platelets Hemoglobin Hematocrit

The RBC count is a key parameter in CBC that measures the number of RBCs in a given volume of blood. This provides valuable insights into oxygen-carrying capacity and overall health. It is used for diagnosing anemia, polycythemia, and other blood-related diseases.

RBC Counting Methods

Impedance Method Coulter Principle
Blood sample is diluted and passed through a small aperture with an electrical current.
Detects electrical disruptions as cells pass through the aperture.

Flow Cytometry
Uses laser-based detection to measure light scatter and fluorescence cytometry for accurate cell differentiation.
Optical analysis measures light scatter for RBC count and size distribution.

Hemocytometer Manual Counting
Blood is diluted and loaded into a hemocytometer.
Cells are counted under a microscope.

Limitations of Existing Methods

Cannot detect overlapping RBCs.
Cannot differentiate platelets or microcytes from RBCs.
High cost of automated methods.
Staining variability requires expertise.
Optical analysis is sensitive to artifacts and sample quality.
Manual hemocytometer is time-intensive, prone to operator errors, and has limited precision.

Analytical Approach

Image processing approach using single-frame analysis.
Handling overlapping cells to improve accuracy.

Tools Used

Python
OpenCV

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Usage

Load the image of RBCs.
Apply preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion and thresholding.
Detect and count RBCs, including overlapping cells.
